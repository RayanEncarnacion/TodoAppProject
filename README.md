# ToDo App Mini Project

This is a ToDo App created as a mini project to showcase skills with Sass and JS (DOM manipulation and Local Storage).

In this project I styled the whole app using partials, variables and mixins with Sass.

The user can create, read, update and delete elements in the DOM using the Local Storage API and DOM Manipulation Techniques.

In this project I was learning about the usage of Local Storage and pushing entire objects using JSON.stringify and retrieving the same objects using JSON.parse, also learning of displaying elements from the Local Storage if an specific item exists inside it (todosArray in this case).
