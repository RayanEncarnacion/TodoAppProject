# ToDo App Mini Project

This is a ToDo app created as a mini project to showcase skills with npm, Sass, JS (DOM manipulation and Local Storage) and GIT fundamentals.

In this project i styled the whole app using partials, variables and mixins with Sass.

Created, read, updated and deleted elements in the DOM using the Local Storage API and DOM manipulation techniques.

This took around 4 hours to complet because i was learning about the usage of Local Storage and pushing entire objects using JSON.stringify and retrieving the same objects using JSON.parse, as well of displaying elements from the Local Storage if an specific item exists inside it (todosArray in this case).
